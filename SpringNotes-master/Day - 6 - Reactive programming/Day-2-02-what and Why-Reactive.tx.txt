What is Reactive Programming

Reactive Programming is a new programming paradigm

It allows Asynchronous and non blocking

3.Data flows as an Event/Message driven stream

4.It support functional style code
5.Back Pressure in data source
Consider app request to DB for data
step2 DB return response back to app
step3. again app sending request for the amount of data
step 4: once the n number of data sent by the DB server as per the requested data amount DB server event will be closed
then app have the choice to request again for data or cancel request , once you cancel request the communication terminated 

the entire process of communication with app and data source known as Back Pressure

Reactive stream follows push based data base model because as the request we are pushing the data to our app

and it is combination of push and pull based data flow model

When to use Reactive Programming?

Use Reactive Programming when there is need to build and support app that can handle high load


Reactive App Architecture:

***Handle request using non blocking style
***Netty is a popular  a non blocking server
         uses Event Loop Style
*********using Project Reactor for writing non blocking code

*********Spring webflux uses Netty and Project Reactor for building non blocking or reactive APIs


  The concept of app controlling the data flow is called back pressure
